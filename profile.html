    <p>Hello, my name is Tia Mocelin and I am a sophomore at the University of Northern Colorado. I am studying communications with the hope of doing Social Media and Digital Marketing for a professional sports team, or ultimately the PBR or PRCA. I grew up playing my soccer my whole life with hopes of playing in the next level
      until I tore my ACL and had a really rough recovery. Because of this, I have always wanted to stay working in sports. I've grown up really close to my entire family, and although they've been in Colorado forever, I cannot wait to move far away as soon as I get my degree. I have two older sisters, 5 neices and nephews, and
      have grown up close to my whole family.</p>
