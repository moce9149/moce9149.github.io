    <h1>Funny Things on the Internet</h1>
    <h3>By: Tia Mocelin</h3>
    <p> Because of the time that were living in, there are many different funny outlets on the internet. On this page you will find funny things that I have found on the web!</p>

    <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>My first favorite funny thing on the internet is Vine compliations on YouTube, I grew up in the generation of Vine and they're still my favorite videos.</p>

    <h2><em>Sometimes</em> Fresh Laugh</h2>
    <p>Another funny thing that I like to look at on the internet is the Buzzfeed quizzes, I like to take them when I'm bored and some are <em>interesting</em>. I've attached a Buzzfeed quiz below.</p>

    <h2>Other Laugh</h2>
    <p>The last thing that I like looking at are cat videos. I have a cat so they make me laugh because my cat does stupid things also.</p>
